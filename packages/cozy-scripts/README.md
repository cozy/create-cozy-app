## What's cozy-scripts?

`cozy-scripts` contains

- common commands used by Cozy developers during application development
- common webpack configs

## Installation

```
yarn add cozy-scripts
```

After installation, the `cozy-scripts` is available.

## CLI commands

`cozy-scripts` has commands to be used inside your application (used by
default in applications created from `create-cozy-app`):

### - `cozy-scripts --show-config`

Outputs the webpack config computed according your current global
variable `NODE_ENV`. By default, the application will have `yarn` scripts (in
the `package.json`) to show the configurations according to different
environments (dev, browser, mobile, prod...).

### - `cozy-scripts build`

Runs webpack for production builds. Built files (destined to the Cozy) will be
in the `build/` directory.

> A `--debug` option is available if you want to ouput more information about
> webpack building in your console.

### - `cozy-scripts start`

Launches the application for development. Its runs webpack in watch mode with
a server (`webpack-dev-server`) to serve application assets. Then, it will
launch a Cozy stack using Docker (the image `cozy/cozy-app-dev`) to serve your
application inside it. This is the preferred method to build a Cozy app during development.

Your application will be available at http://<MY_APP_SLUG>.cozy.tools:8080.

:warning: If you want to build a [service](https://docs.cozy.io/en/howTos/dev/services/),
you should use `cozy-scripts watch` (see below).

> In this mode [HMR (Hot Module
> Replacement)](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) is
> available to help you with the application development.

### - `cozy-scripts watch`

Run webpack in watch mode: each time you modify a file, a new build will be triggered. 
This is only recommended for [service](https://docs.cozy.io/en/howTos/dev/services/) build.
The built files (destined to the Cozy) will be in `build/`.

> A `--debug` options is available if you want to ouput more information
> about webpack building in your console.


### Common flags for `build` / `watch` / `start`

#### `--production` / `--development`

Configures the build mode.

This mode will be overwritten by `process.env.NODE_ENV` (ex:
`browser:development` for development usage with browser target).

#### `--browser` / `--mobile`

Configures the build target.

This target will be overwritten by `process.env.NODE_ENV` (ex:
`browser:development` for development usage with browser target).

#### `--analyzer`

Use this option if you want to analyze your builds content using the webpack
plugin
[`webpack-bundle-analyzer`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer).
It will open you browser with an interactive treemap visualization of the
contents of all your bundles.

##### `--src-dir`, `--build-dir`, `--manifest`

Use these options if you want to `build`/`watch`/`start` your application with
custom paths. These paths __must be relative to the application root
directory__:

- `--src-dir`: the `src` directory, the source files of your application
- `--build-dir`: the directory to put the application build files into
- `--manifest`: the path of your manifest file `manifest.webapp` (the `.webapp` extension must be provided)

### - `cozy-scripts test`

Runs the application tests using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).
This command handles all parameters than Jest does, like `--watch` for the
watch mode or `-u` to update snapshots for example.

### - `cozy-scripts publish`

Fetches and runs the latest version of the [`cozy-app-publish`
CLI](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-libs/tree/master/packages/cozy-app-publish)
to publish your application on a Cozy registry (by default the official and
main Cozy Cloud applications registry on
`https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc`). The options and arguments are the same
than in the [`cozy-app-publish` package
documentation](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-libs/tree/master/packages/cozy-app-publish).

### - `cozy-scripts release`

Releases a new version of the application. The first step is to start the
release using `cozy-scripts release start`. It will create a new release
branch according to your current version and it will bump the version on your
master branch. Then you can release new versions (on your release branch)
using `cozy-scripts release patch|beta|stable` according to your needs.

By default, this script will push on the `origin` remote but you can change by
passing it to your script after the action name: `cozy-scripts release start
cozy` to use the remote named `cozy`.

__You can find more informations about this library and how to use it in
[`cozy-release`
documentation](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-libs/tree/master/packages/cozy-app-publish)__

> :warning: __BE VERY CAREFUL__ using this script since __it will push
>     directly to your remote repository__. A prompt will warn you before
>     starting the release.


### Webpack configurations

`cozy-scripts` is designed to use a default webpack configuration for a basic
React/Redux application which uses `cozy-ui` and `cozy-client-js`. But you can
override or use your custom configuration files by creating a new
`app.config.js` file in your application root folder. Here is an example to
overload the default bundle config with a custom one:

```javascript
// myapp/app.config.js
module.exports = [
  // default for React/Redux
  require('cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.default.js'),
  require('./config/webpack.myconfig.js')
]
```

### TypeScript

TypeScript is lightly supported: type checking and linting are disabled, but files can be compiled.
In order to use this feature your application needs to have
`@babel/preset-env` and `@babel/preset-typescript` installed.
Your babel config also needs to declare those presets, for instance: 

```javascript
// myapp/babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['cozy-app', '@babel/typescript', '@babel/env']
}
```

### `cozy-flags`

`cozy-scripts` works well with
[cozy-flags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cozy-flags). You can specify a few
flags on build time :

```
COZY_FLAGS=flag1,flag2 yarn build
```

```js
import flag from 'cozy-flags'
 
if (flag('flag1') ||Â flag('flag2')) {
  enableMyFeature()
}
```


You can find more information about webpack configuration files available via
`cozy-scripts` in the dedicated [webpack configs
documentation](docs/webpack-configs.md).

If you need more custom configurations and need to use the
[`webpack-merge`](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge#merging-with-strategies)
smart mode or merge strategies, you can also find more information about in
the dedicated [merge strategies
documentation](docs/webpack-merge-strategies.md).

> :warning: `cozy-scripts` internally uses __Webpack v4__, be sure to use
>     Webpack 4 compatible configurations if you want to provide custom
>     __configurations in the `app.config.js`__
